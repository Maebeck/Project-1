Our project is to create a website that will find the cheapest flight from the user's origin, to their destination, as well as finding events in the area of their destination for the duration of their trip.

We will use some API to find the cheapest flight from the origin to the destination, with the departing flight being set on the user provided start date, and the return flight being set on the user provided end date.
